Pre-Final Topics

1) ADT Tree and implementations  
   * Definition of a tree 
   * Basic concepts and terms related to tree
   * Tree Traversals [Preorder, Inorder, Postorder]
   * ADT Tree Implementations
     a) Parent Pointer Implementation
     b) List of Children Implementation
   * Binary Tree definition and Implementations 
   * Expression Trees
   * Huffman Code

2) Binary Search Tree (BST) 
   * Description and Implementation
   * Operations: Insert, Delete, and Member
   * Similarity and Difference between BST and AVL trees
   * Binary Search vs. Sequential Search

3) ADT Priority Queue
   * Partially Ordered Tree (POT)
   * Min and Max heap
      - MinHeap ==> Operations: insert and deleteMin
      - MaxHeap ==> Operations: insert and deleteMax
    * MinHeapify and MaxHeapify
      Version 1: Insert all elements in an initially empty POT
      Version 2: Heapify starting with lowest level parent
      
4) Heapsort Sorting Technique (in place)
