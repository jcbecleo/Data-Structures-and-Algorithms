Pre-midterm Topics

1)  Abstract Data Type (ADT)

2)  ADT List 
     a) Differentiate a List from and ADT List.
     b) List Operations:  Initialize, insert, delete, member, locate, and other operations  
     c) Implementations of ADT List:
        i) Array Implementation (4 versions)
           Version 1: List is a structure containing an array and variable count
                     Note: count represents the actual number of elements in the array
                           If MAX is the size of the array, count <= MAX
           Version 2: List is a pointer to a structure containing an array  and variable count
           Version 3: List is a structure containing a pointer to the 1st element of a dynamic array, and variable count
           Version 4: List is a pointer to a structure containing a pointer to the 1st element of a dynamic array, and variable count 
        ii) Linked List Implementation (Singly Link)
       iii) Cursor-based Implementation
      d) Time Complexity of the List operations in different implementations : O(1), O(N), and O(N*N)

3) ADT Stack and Implementations
   a) What is an ADT Stack?
    b) Stack Operations:  Top, Pop, Push, and other utility functions such as initStack, isEmpty, and isFull 
    c) Implementations 
        i) Array Implementation (4 versions)
       ii) Linked List Implementation
      iii) Cursor-based Implementation
    d) Time Complexity:  O(1) and O(N)

4) ADT Queue and Implementations
    a) What is an ADT Queue?
    b) Queue Operations: Front, Dequeue, Enqueue, and other utility functions such as initQueue, isEmpty, and isFull
    c) Implementations
        i) Linked List Implementation
           1) Queue is a pointer to a dynamically allocated node
           2) Queue is a structure containing front and rear pointers to dynamically allocated node/s
        ii) Circular Array Implementation
            Solution 1: Add a counter
            Solution 2:  Queue is full if there are MAX-1 elements 
                          where MAX is the size of the array
    d) Time Complexity:  O(1) and O(N)

Topics for the Midterm

1) Set and ADT Set
   a) ADT Set vs. ADT List 
     - What are the differences between the two?
   b) ADT's based on Set
      1) ADT UID 
         * an ADT based on set with operations Union, Intersection, and set Difference
         * Implementations
           i) Array, Linked list, and cursor-based implementations
          ii) Bit-Vector Implementation
         iii) Computer Word Implementation
              - Shift operators:  >>  and <<
              - Bit-wise operators:  &  ^  |  ~
       2) ADT Dictionary
          * An ADT based on set with Operations: Insert, Delete, and Member
          * Two types of Hashing:
            a) Open Hashing (or External Hashing)
            b) Closed Hashing (or Internal Hashing) 

         * Closed Hashing Terms: Collision, Synonyms, Linear Hashing or Probing, Displacement, Packing Density (Load Factor), Average Search Length, Perfect Hash Function
         * Closed Hashing variations
         * Closed Hashing in external Memory (Files: fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, fseek)
